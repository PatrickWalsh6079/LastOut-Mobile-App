Last One Out 🚪📍
Last One Out is a cross-platform mobile app built with React Native and Expo that helps track whether you are the last person inside a building. Using background geolocation and real-time notifications, the app detects when a user enters or exits a designated location. If you're the last one remaining inside or the last to leave, you'll receive a notification—ensuring no one is accidentally left behind or left the building unsecured.

Key Features
🔔 Local Notifications: Get alerted when your status changes between being "in" or "out" of the building.

📍 Background Geolocation: Tracks your location in real time—even when the app is not actively in use.

👤 User Identification: Each user selects a username on first launch so their activity is tracked separately.

☁️ Firebase Integration: All location data is securely stored in Firestore for real-time collaboration and monitoring.

🔒 Privacy Focused: Location data is only used to determine entry/exit and is not shared with third parties.
